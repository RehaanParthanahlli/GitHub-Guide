    How to Download GitHub CLI in windows ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * PHASE 0 — Prerequisites (must already exist)

    Before gh, you must already have:

    Git installed

    git --version


    A GitHub account

    Basic Git config done

    git config --global user.name
    git config --global user.email


    If Git itself is not configured, gh is useless.

    PHASE 1 — Install GitHub CLI (gh)

    What installation will do:

    Add gh binary to your system

    Make gh command available in terminal

    After install, you should be able to run:

    gh --version


    ⚠️ Installation does NOT:

    log you in

    link repos

    change Git behavior

    PHASE 2 — Authentication (MOST IMPORTANT)

    After install, you must authenticate.

    This step:

    Links your terminal to your GitHub account

    Stores credentials securely

    Allows gh to act on your behalf

    Command (later):

    gh auth login


    You will choose:

    GitHub.com

    HTTPS or SSH

    Browser-based login (recommended)

    PHASE 3 — Verification & config

    After login, we verify:

    Auth status

    gh auth status


    GitHub user

    gh api user


    Default repo protocol

    gh config get git_protocol


    Optional configs:

    editor

    browser

    default repo visibility

    PHASE 4 — Basic daily commands (after setup)

    Only after everything above works, we start using:

    Repo
    gh repo clone
    gh repo view

    Pull Requests
    gh pr create
    gh pr list
    gh pr checkout

    Issues
    gh issue create
    gh issue list


    ⚠️ None of these will work without Phase 2.

    Key mental separation (non-negotiable)
    Tool	Responsibility
    git	commits, branches, history
    gh	PRs, issues, GitHub UI actions

    gh does not replace Git.
